  abstract={Diabetes mellitus remains a major global health issue, and great attention is directed at natural therapeutics. This systematic review aimed to assess the potential of flavonoids as antidiabetic agents by investigating their inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase and α-amylase, two key enzymes involved in starch digestion. Six scientific databases (PubMed, Virtual Health Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and WHO Global Index Medicus) were searched until August 21, 2022, for in vitro studies reporting IC50 values of purified flavonoids on α-amylase and α-glucosidase, along with corresponding data for acarbose as a positive control. A total of 339 eligible articles were analyzed, resulting in the retrieval of 1643 flavonoid structures. These structures were rigorously standardized and curated, yielding 974 unique compounds, among which 177 flavonoids exhibited inhibition of both α-glucosidase and α-amylase are presented. Quality assessment utilizing a modified CONSORT checklist and structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis were performed, revealing crucial features for the simultaneous inhibition of flavonoids against both enzymes. Moreover, the review also addressed several limitations in the current research landscape and proposed potential solutions. The curated datasets are available online at https://github.com/MedChemUMP/FDIGA.},

  title={Identification of Putative Orthosteric and Allosteric Binding Sites of Interleukin-33 using Extensive Molecular Dynamics Simulations},
  author={Mai, Tan and Lam, Thua-Phong and Pham, Long-Hung and Nguyen, Kim-Hung and Thai, Khac-Minh},
  abstract={Interleukin (IL)-33, the newest member of the IL-1 family, plays a pivotal role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases through its protein-protein interaction (PPI) with the ST2 receptor. Targeting this interaction holds promise for disease management. Although the IL-33/ST2 complex crystal structure has been resolved for nearly a decade, no comprehensive investigations into the druggability of IL-33 have been conducted. Furthermore, while several IL-33 inhibitors have been reported, their binding mechanisms have predominantly relied on rudimentary molecular docking approaches. In this study, we sought to identify possible druggable sites on the IL-33 surface using mixed-solvent molecular dynamics (MixMD) simulations and propose the possible mechanism of action of a reported IL-33 inhibitor using extensive-MD simulations. MixMD is an advanced MD technique that not only captures the protein's flexibility but also considers its interactions with small chemical probes. Our findings revealed five potential druggable sites on the IL-33 surface, two of which overlaid well with the interface of the ST2 receptor. The three remaining sites were investigated for their allosteric potential via all-atom normal mode analysis in the presence of pseudoligands. The current results suggested that interaction with these binding sites could exert possible dynamical change compared to the apoprotein conformation and serve as starting points for IL-33 allosteric modulation. Additionally, the binding modes of an orthosteric IL-33 inhibitor were also extracted and analyzed using the results from a 5-microseconds simulation. Our study can pave the way for future studies aiming to modulate the PPI of IL-33/ST2 employing both orthosteric and allosteric approaches.},

  abstract={Diabetes mellitus is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide, accounting for 6.7 million deaths in 2021, and is one of the most rapidly growing global health emergencies of this century. Although several classes of therapeutic drugs have been invented and applied in clinical practice, diabetes continues to pose a serious and growing threat to public health and places a tremendous burden on those affected and their families. The strategy of reducing carbohydrate digestibility by inhibiting the activities of α-glucosidase and α-amylase is regarded as a promising preventative treatment for type 2 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the dual inhibitory effect against two polysaccharide hydrolytic enzymes of flavonoid derivatives from an in-house chemical database. By combining molecular docking and structure–activity relationship analysis, twelve compounds with docking energies less than or equal to − 8.0 kcal mol−1 and containing required structural features for dual inhibition of the two enzymes were identified and subjected to chemical synthesis and in vitro evaluation. The obtained results showed that five compounds exhibited dual inhibitory effects on the target enzymes with better IC50 values than the approved positive control acarbose. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to elucidate the binding of these flavonoids to the enzymes. The predicted pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties suggest that these compounds are viable for further development as type 2 diabetes drugs.},

  abstract={The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global public health emergency on 23 July 2022. This disease was caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), which was first identified in 1958 in Denmark. The MPXV is a member of the Poxviridae family, the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, and the genus Orthopoxvirus, which share high similarities with the vaccinia virus (the virus used to produce the smallpox vaccine). For the initial stage of infection, the MPXV needs to attach to the human cell surface glycosaminoglycan (GAG) adhesion molecules using its E8 protein. However, up until now, neither a structure for the MPXV E8 protein nor a specific cure for the MPXV exists. This study aimed to search for small molecules that inhibit the MPXV E8 protein, using computational approaches. In this study, a high-quality three-dimensional structure of the MPXV E8 protein was retrieved by homology modeling using the AlphaFold deep learning server. Subsequent molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) for a cumulative duration of 2.1 microseconds revealed that ZINC003977803 (Diosmin) and ZINC008215434 (Flavin adenine dinucleotide-FAD) could be potential inhibitors against the E8 protein with the MM/GBSA binding free energies of −38.19 ± 9.69 and −35.59 ± 7.65 kcal·mol−1, respectively.},

	abstract = {The main protease 3CLpro is one of the potential targets against coronavirus. Inhibiting this enzyme leads to the interruption of viral replication. Chalcone and its derivatives were reported to possess the ability to bind to 3CLpro protease in the binding pocket. This study explored an in-house database of 269 chalcones as 3CLpro inhibitors using in silico screening models, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculation, and ADME prediction. C264 and C235 stand out as the two most potential structures. The top hit compound C264 was with the Jamda score of −2.8329 and the MM/GBSA binding energy mean value of −28.23 ± 3.53 kcal/mol, which was lower than the reference ligand. Despite the lower mean binding energy (−22.07 ± 3.39 kcal/mol), in-depth analysis of binding interaction suggested C235 could be another potential candidate. Further, in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to confirm the inhibitory ability.},
