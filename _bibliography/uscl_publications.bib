	abstract={Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are integral in critical infrastructures such as power grids, transportation networks, and production systems. Ensuring the resilient operation of these large-scale NCSs against cyber-attacks is crucial for societal well-being. Over the past two decades, extensive research has been focused on developing metrics to quantify the vulnerabilities of NCSs against attacks. Once the vulnerabilities are quantified, mitigation strategies can be employed to enhance system resilience. This article provides a comprehensive overview of methods developed for assessing NCS vulnerabilities and the corresponding mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of probabilistic risk metrics to model vulnerabilities under adversaries with imperfect process knowledge. The article concludes by outlining promising directions for future research.},

  abstract = {The cyclic output-to-output gain is a security metric for control systems. Commonly, it is computed by solving a semidefinite program, which scales badly and inhibits its use for large-scale systems. We propose a method for computing the cyclic output-to-output gain using Hamiltonian matrices, similar to existing methods for the H∞-norm. In contrast to existing methods for the H∞-norm, the proposed method considers generalized singular values rather than regular singular values. Moreover, to ensure that the Hamiltonian matrices exist, we introduce a regularized version of the cyclic output-to-output gain. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method is more efficient, scalable, and reliable than semi-definite programming approaches.},

Unlike previous methods, our approach avoids computing left-eigenvectors, eliminating numerical inaccuracies, and achieves polynomial time complexity that scales better than existing methods requiring network augmentation. Additionally, our method provides the strongest privacy protection with zero information leakage while maintaining exact consensus accuracy, unlike approaches that trade accuracy for privacy. We illustrate the method with examples covering diverse faulty agent scenarios.},

We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the gain by leveraging duality, dissipativity, and applying the semidefinite version of the Farkas Lemma. The analysis yields a rigorous characterization of attack feasibility: we equivalently formulate the problem as a definite programming problem and we show that it admits a solution if and only if the non-minimum phase zeros of the detection subsystem are shared with the performance subsystem. This condition enables the precise assessment of an attacker’s ability to induce maximal disruption while evading detection. The proposed framework offers both theoretical insight and a tractable computational formulation that facilitates practical vulnerability analysis. The obtained results are validated through numerical examples.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the secure state estimation problem for continuous linear time-invariant systems with non-periodic and asynchronous sampled measurements, where the sensors need to transmit not only measurements but also sampling time-stamps to the fusion center. This measurement and communication setup is well-suited for operating large-scale control systems and, at the same time, introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries through (i) manipulation of measurements, (ii) manipulation of time-stamps, (iii) elimination of measurements, (iv) generation of completely new false measurements, or a combination of these attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we propose a decentralized estimation algorithm in which each sensor maintains its local state estimate asynchronously based on its measurements. The local states are synchronized through time prediction and fused after time-stamp alignment. In the absence of attacks, state estimates are proven to recover the optimal Kalman estimates by solving a weighted least square problem. In the presence of attacks, solving this weighted least square problem with the aid of $\ell_1$ regularization provides secure state estimates with uniformly bounded error under an observability redundancy assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a distributed diagnosis scheme to detect and estimate actuator and power line faults in DC microgrids subject to unknown power loads and stochastic noise. To address actuator faults, we design a fault estimation filter whose parameters are determined through a tractable optimization problem to achieve fault estimation, decoupling from power line faults, and robustness against noise. In contrast, the estimation of power line faults poses greater challenges due to the inherent coupling between fault currents and unknown power loads, which becomes ill-posed when the underlying system is insufficiently excited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address this critical yet underexplored issue. Our solution introduces a novel differentiate-before-estimate strategy. A set of diagnostic rules based on the temporal characteristics of a constructed residual is developed to distinguish load changes from line faults. Once a power line fault is detected, a regularized least-squares method is activated to estimate the fault currents, for which we further derive an upper bound on the estimation error. Finally, comprehensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Our framework is scalable, adaptive, and seamlessly integrates into FL workflows. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its robust performance against a variety of poisoning attacks, achieving high True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) of malicious and benign clients, respectively, while maintaining model accuracy.

However, the presence of malicious (Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL, particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data and a large proportion of malicious clients.},

	abstract={This paper addresses the security allocation problem in a networked control system under stealthy injection attacks. The networked system is comprised of interconnected subsystems which are represented by nodes in a digraph. An adversary compromises the system by injecting false data into several nodes with the aim of maximally disrupting the performance of the network while remaining stealthy to a defender. To minimize the impact of such stealthy attacks, the defender, with limited knowledge about attack policies and attack resources, allocates several sensors on nodes to impose the stealthiness constraint governing the attack policy. We provide an optimal security allocation algorithm to minimize the expected attack impact on the entire network. Furthermore, under a suitable local control design, the proposed security allocation algorithm can be executed in a scalable way. Finally, the obtained results are validated through several numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making them prime targets for adversarial attacks. Timely detection and mitigation of such attacks are imperative for the safe operation of CPS. This paper proposes a novel
residual generator design method for enhanced detection of bias injection attacks (BIAs) in linear CPS driven by white Gaussian noise. Specifically, we define a flexible attack impact metric based on the weighted norm of the injected bias and a detectability metric based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using these two metrics, we characterize the worst-case BIAs as those that minimize detectability while maintaining a specified minimum impact. For residual generation filter synthesis, we formulate two optimization problems: one for maximizing the detectability of worst-case BIAs at the attack onset and the other at steady state. Since these two problems are inherently conflicting, we employ the ϵ-constraint method to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions that balance transient and steady-state detectability. The effectiveness of the proposed filter design method is demonstrated through numerical simulations, with a comparison against two state-of-the-art benchmarks: the Kalman filter and the H_/H2 filter.},

In particular, we consider a large-scale system composed of a certain subsystem interconnected with an uncertain subsystem, where only the input-output channels are accessible. An adversary is assumed to inject false data to maximize the performance loss of the certain subsystem while remaining undetected. By abstracting the uncertain subsystem as a class of admissible systems satisfying an L2 gain constraint, the worst-case performance loss is obtained as the solution to a convex semi-definite program depending only on the certain subsystem dynamics and such an L2 gain constraint. This solution is proved to serve as an upper bound for the actual worst-case performance loss when the model of the entire system is fully certain. The results are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the power transmission grid spanning Sweden and Northern Denmark.},

  booktitle = {Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (L4DC)},
  abstract={Safety filters ensure that control actions that are executed are always safe, no matter the controller in question. Previous work has proposed a simple and stealthy false-data injection attack for deactivating such safety filters. This attack injects false sensor measurements to bias state estimates toward the interior of a safety region, making the safety filter accept unsafe control actions. The attack does, however, require the adversary to know the dynamics of the system, the safety region used in the safety filter, and the observer gain. In this work we relax these requirements and show how a similar data-injection attack can be performed when the adversary only observes the input and output of the observer that is used by the safety filter, without any a priori knowledge about the system dynamics, safety region, or observer gain. In particular, the adversary uses the observed data to identify a state-space model that describes the observer dynamics, and then approximates a safety region in the identified embedding. We exemplify the data-driven attack on an inverted pendulum, where we show how the attack can make the system leave a safe set, even when a safety filter is supposed to stop this from happening.},

Despite the perceived simplicity of this attack strategy, BIAs pose a significant risk to systems that have an integrator in their open-loop dynamics, as the residual generated by any linear observer will be identical under attack and normal operation at steadystate. Consequently, such attacks are detectable only for a limited duration during the transient phase.

A malicious adversary selects a single vertex on which to conduct a stealthy data injection attack to maximally disrupt the local performance while remaining undetected.

First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in probabilistic ways, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to a subset of available vertex sets. Then, we cast the problem of security allocation in a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the contribution of this paper is highlighted by utilizing the proposed admissible actions of the defender in the context of large-scale networks.

The methodology involves comparing the worst-case attack impact for both the optimal and centrality-based security allocation solutions. The results demonstrate that the centrality measure approach enables significantly faster allocation of security resources with acceptable levels of performance loss compared to the optimal solution, making it suitable for large-scale networks.

However, when datasets of participants are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID), models trained by naive federated algorithms may be biased towards certain participants, and model performance across participants is non-uniform. This is known as the fairness problem in federated learning. In this paper, we formulate fairness-controlled federated learning as a dynamical multi-objective optimization problem to ensure fair performance across all participants. To solve the problem efficiently, we study the convergence and bias of Adam as the server optimizer in federated learning, and propose Adaptive Federated Adam (AdaFedAdam) to accelerate fair federated learning with alleviated bias. We validated the effectiveness, Pareto optimality and robustness of AdaFedAdam in numerical experiments and show that AdaFedAdam outperforms existing algorithms, providing better convergence and fairness properties of the federated scheme.},

When the system undergoes a deception attack, the controller receives a modified output, deviating from the sensor’s original measurement. We implement the input delay approach and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique to obtain sufficient conditions, expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), that characterize the duration of the DoS interruptions under which input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system is preserved. Furthermore, we explore scenarios involving simultaneous attacks, where the DoS is modeled as a stochastic Bernoulli process. The closed-loop system is then considered as a stochastic impulsive system. In a similar manner, we derive conditions to ensure mean-square ISS for this case.

	year = {2024},
	abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely used to identify anomalies in computer networks and raise alarms on intrusive behaviors. ML-based IDSs generally take network traces or host logs as input to extract patterns from individual samples, whereas the inter-dependencies of network are often not captured and learned, which may result in a large amount of uncertain predictions, false positives, and false negatives. To tackle the challenges in intrusion detection, we propose a graph neural network based intrusion detection system (GNN-IDS), which is data-driven and machine learning-empowered. In GNN-IDS, the attack graph and real-time measurements, representing the static and dynamic attributes of computer networks, respectively, are incorporated and associated to represent the complex computer networks. Graph neural networks are employed as the inference engine for intrusion detection. By learning network connectivity, graph neural networks can quantify the importance of neighboring nodes and node features to make more reliable predictions. Furthermore, by incorporating an attack graph, GNN-IDS could not only detect anomalies but also identify the malicious actions causing the anomalies.

We propose a simple and stealthy false-data injection attack for deactivating such safety filters; in particular, we focus on deactivating safety filters that are based on control barrier functions. The attack injects false sensor measurements to bias state estimates to the interior of a safety region, which makes the safety filter accept unsafe control actions. To detect such attacks, we also propose a detector that detects biases manufactured by the proposed attack policy, which complements conventional detectors when safety filters are used. The proposed attack policy and detector are illustrated on a double integrator example.},

  abstract = {Modern glucose sensors deployed in closed-loop insulin delivery systems, so-called artificial pancreas use wireless communication channels. While this allows a flexible system design, it also introduces vulnerability to cyberattacks. Timely detection and mitigation of attacks are imperative for device safety. However, large unknown meal disturbances are a crucial challenge in determining whether the sensor has been compromised or the sensor glucose trajectories are normal. We address this issue from a control-theoretic security perspective. In particular, a time-varying Kalman filter is employed to handle the sporadic meal intakes. The filter prediction error is then statistically evaluated to detect anomalies if present. We compare two state-of-the-art online anomaly detection algorithms, namely the $\chi^2$ and CUSUM tests. We establish a robust optimal detection rule for unknown bias injections. Even if the optimality holds only for the restrictive case of constant bias injections, we show that the proposed model-based anomaly detection scheme is also effective for generic non-stealthy sensor deception attacks through numerical simulations},

  abstract={Sustained use of critical infrastructure, such as electrical power and water distribution networks, requires efficient management and control. Facilitated by the advancements in computational devices and non-proprietary communication technology, such as the Internet, the efficient operation of critical infrastructure relies on network decomposition into interconnected subsystems, thus forming networked control systems. However, the use of public and pervasive communication channels leaves these systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. Consequently, the critical infrastructure is put at risk of suffering operation disruption and even physical damage that would inflict financial costs as well as pose a hazard to human health. Therefore, security is crucial to the sustained efficient operation of critical infrastructure.

  This thesis develops a framework for evaluating and improving the security of networked control systems in the face of cyber attacks. The considered security problem involves two strategic agents, namely a malicious adversary and a defender, pursuing their specific and conflicting goals. The defender aims to efficiently allocate defense resources with the purpose of detecting malicious activities. Meanwhile, the malicious adversary simultaneously conducts cyber attacks and remains stealthy to the defender. We tackle the security problem by proposing a game-theoretic framework and characterizing its main components: the payoff function, the action space, and the available information for each agent. Especially, the payoff function is characterized based on the output-to-output gain security metric that fully explores the worst-case attack impact. Then, we investigate the properties of the game and how to efficiently compute its equilibrium. Given the combinatorial nature of the defender's actions, one important challenge is to alleviate the computational burden. To overcome this challenge, the thesis contributes several system- and graph-theoretic conditions that enable the defender to shrink the action space, efficiently allocating the defense resources. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical examples.},

Unfortunately, due to the self-loop dynamics of the agents (an agent’s current state depends only on its own immediately previous state, i.e., one time-step in the past), they often lack privacy guarantees. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel design that consists of a network augmentation, where each agent uses the previous iteration values and the newly received ones to increase the privacy guarantees. To formally evaluate the privacy of a network of agents, we define the concept of privacy index, which intuitively measures the minimum number of agents that should work in coalition to recover all the initial states. Moreover, we aim to explore if there is a trade-off between privacy and accuracy (rate of convergence) or if we can increase both. We unveil that, with the proposed method, we can design networks with higher privacy index and faster convergence rates. Remarkably, we further ensure that the network always reaches consensus even when the original network does not. Finally, we illustrate the proposed method with examples and present networks that lead to higher privacy levels and, in the majority of the cases, to faster consensus rates.},

The risk is formulated using a well-established risk metric, namely the maximum expected loss. Under this setups, the risk assessment problem corresponds to an untractable infinite non-convex optimization problem. To address this limitation, we adopt the framework of scenario-based optimization to approximate the infinite non-convex optimization problem by a sampled non-convex optimization problem. Then, based on the framework of dissipative system theory and S-procedure, the sampled non-convex risk assessment problem is formulated as an equivalent convex semi-definite program. Additionally, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the risk to be bounded. Finally, we illustrate the results through numerical simulation of a hydro-turbine power system.},

Since the impact is a random variable, due to system uncertainty, we use Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to characterize the risk associated with the attack. We then consider the problem of allocating the security measures which minimize the risk. We assume that there are only a limited number of security measures available. Under this constraint, we observe that the allocation problem is a mixed-integer optimization problem. Thus we use relaxation techniques to approximate the security allocation problem into a Semi-Definite Program (SDP). We also compare our allocation method (i) across different risk measures: the worst-case measure, the average (nominal) measure, and (ii) across different search algorithms: the exhaustive and the greedy search algorithms.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a secure state estimation scheme with non-periodic asynchronous measurements for linear continuous-time systems under false data attacks on the measurement transmit channel. After sampling the output of the system, a sensor transmits the measurement information in a triple composed of sensor index, time-stamp, and measurement value to the fusion center via vulnerable communication channels. The malicious attacker can corrupt a subset of the sensors through (i) manipulating the time-stamp and measurement value; (ii) blocking transmitted measurement triples; or (iii) injecting fake measurement triples. To deal with such attacks, we propose the design of local estimators based on observability space decomposition, where each local estimator updates the local state and sends it to the fusion center after sampling a measurement. Whenever there is a local update, the fusion center combines all the local states and generates a secure state estimate by adopting the median operator. We prove that local estimators of benign sensors are unbiased with stable covariance. Moreover, the fused central estimation error has bounded expectation and covariance against at most p corrupted sensors as long as the system is 2p-sparse observable. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through an application on a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.},

In this paper, we propose a parsimonious policy to reduce the average number of watermarking events when the attack is not present, which in turn reduces the control cost. We model the system as a stochastic optimal control problem and apply the dynamic programming to minimize the average detection delay (ADD) for fixed upper bounds on false alarm rate (FAR) and increased control cost. The optimal solution results in a two threshold policy on the posterior probability of attack, which is derived from the Shiryaev statistics for sequential change detection assuming the change point is a random variable with a geometric distribution. We derive approximate expressions of ADD and FAR applying the non-linear renewal theory. The relationship between the average number of watermarking added before the attack and the increase in control cost is also derived. We design the optimal watermarking that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence for a fixed increase in the control cost. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate and validate the theoretical results.}

In our previous work, we developed a framework for constructing Bayesian Network (BN) models to enable operators to distinguish between those two classes, including knowledge elicitation to construct the directed acyclic graph of BN models. In this paper, we add a systematic method for knowledge elicitation to construct the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of BN models, thereby completing a holistic framework to distinguish between attacks and technical failures. In order to elicit reliable probabilities from experts, we need to reduce the workload of experts in probability elicitation by reducing the number of conditional probabilities to elicit and facilitating individual probability entry. We utilise DeMorgan models to reduce the number of conditional probabilities to elicit as they are suitable for modelling opposing influences i.e., combinations of influences that promote and inhibit the child event. To facilitate individual probability entry, we use probability scales with numerical and verbal anchors. We demonstrate the proposed approach using an example from the water management domain.}

We derive the expressions of the supremum of the average detection delay (SADD) for a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system under the optimal and sub-optimal CUSUM tests. The SADD is asymptotically inversely proportional to the expected KullbackLeibler divergence (KLD) under certain conditions. The expressions for the MIMO case are simplified for multi-input and single-output systems and explored further to distil design insights. We provide insights into the design of an optimal watermarking signal to maximize KLD for a given fixed increase in LQG control cost when there is no attack. Furthermore, we investigate how the attacker and the control system designer can accomplish their respective objectives by changing the relative power of the attack signal and the watermarking signal.

The networked control system is composed of interconnected agents where each agent is regulated by its local controller over unprotected communication, which leaves the system vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks. To guarantee a given local performance, the defender optimally selects a single agent on which to place a detector at its local controller with the purpose of detecting cyber-attacks. On the other hand, an adversary optimally chooses a single agent on which to conduct a cyber-attack on its input with the aim of maximally worsening the local performance while remaining stealthy to the defender. First, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that the maximal attack impact on the local performance is bounded, which restricts the possible actions of the defender to a subset of available agents. Then, by considering the maximal attack impact on the local performance as a game payoff, we cast the problem of finding optimal actions of the defender and the adversary as a zero-sum game. Finally, with the possible action sets of the defender and the adversary, an algorithm is devoted to determining the Nash equilibria of the zero-sum game that yield the optimal detector placement. The proposed method is illustrated on an IEEE benchmark for power systems.}

Different from the design of offline attacks, which is only based on the system's model, to design the online attack, the attacker also estimates the system's state with the intercepted data at each instant and computes the optimal attack accordingly. To ensure stealthiness, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the innovations with and without attacks at each instant should be smaller than a threshold. We show that the attacker should solve a convex optimization problem at each instant to compute the mean and covariance of the attack. The feasibility of the attack policy is also discussed. Furthermore, for the strictly stealthy case with zero threshold, the analytic expression of the unique optimal attack is given. Finally, a numerical example of the longitudinal flight control system is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack.},

The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game with two players, namely a malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected performance vertex, we consider a detector, with uncertain system knowledge, that selects another vertex on which to place a sensor and monitors its output with the aim of detecting the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary, also with uncertain system knowledge, chooses a single vertex and conducts a cyber-attack on its input. The purpose of the adversary is to drive the attack vertex as to maximally disrupt the protected performance vertex while remaining undetected by the detector. As our first contribution, the game payoff of the above-defined zero-sum game is formulated in terms of the Value-at-Risk of the adversary's impact. However, this game payoff corresponds to an intractable optimization problem. To tackle the problem, we adopt the scenario approach to approximately compute the game payoff. Then, the optimal monitor selection is determined by analyzing the equilibrium of the zero-sum game.

Therefore, we formulate the problem of data deception attack detection for NCS with the facility to add physical watermarking as a stochastic optimal control problem. Then we solve the problem by applying dynamic programming value iterations and find a parsimonious watermarking policy that decides to add watermarking and detects attacks based on the estimated posterior probability of attack. We analyze the optimal policy structure and find that it can be a one, two or three threshold policy depending on a few parameter values. Simulation studies show that the optimal policy for a practical range of parameter values is a two-threshold policy on the posterior probability of attack. Derivation of a threshold-based policy from the structural analysis of the value iteration method reduces the computational complexity during the runtime implementation and offers better structural insights.

  abstract ={This paper firstly addresses the problem of risk assessment under false data injection attacks on uncertain control systems. We consider an adversary with complete system knowledge, injecting stealthy false data into an uncertain control system. We then use the Value-at-Risk to characterize the risk associated with the attack impact caused by the adversary. The worst-case attack impact is characterized by the recently proposed output-to-output gain. We observe that the risk assessment problem corresponds to an infinite non-convex robust optimization problem. To this end, we use dissipative system theory and the scenario approach to approximate the risk-assessment problem into a convex problem and also provide probabilistic certificates on approximation. Secondly, we con-sider the problem of security measure allocation. We consider an operator with a constraint on the security budget. Under this constraint, we propose an algorithm to optimally allocate the security measures using the calculated risk such that the resulting Value-at-risk is minimized. Finally, we illustrate the results through a numerical example. The numerical example also illustrates that the security allocation using the Value-at-risk, and the impact on the nominal system may have different outcomes: thereby depicting the benefit of using risk metrics.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to address the problem of optimal sensor placement for detecting cyber-attacks in networked control systems. The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game with two players, namely a malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected target vertex, the detector places a sensor at a single vertex to monitor the system and detect the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary selects a single vertex through which to conduct a cyber-attack that maximally disrupts the target vertex while remaining undetected by the detector. As our first contribution, for a given pair of attack and monitor vertices and a known target vertex, the game payoff function is defined as the output-to-output gain of the respective system. Then, the paper characterizes the set of feasible actions by the detector that ensures bounded values of the game payoff. Finally, an algebraic sufficient condition is proposed to examine whether a given vertex belongs to the set of feasible monitor vertices. The optimal sensor placement is then determined by computing the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the zero-sum game through linear programming. The approach is illustrated via a numerical example of a 10-vertex networked control system with a given target vertex.},

This paper considers bias injection attacks on the glucose sensor deployed in an artificial pancreas. Modern glucose sensors transmit measurements through wireless communication that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which must be timely detected and mitigated. To this end, we propose a model-based anomaly detection scheme using a Kalman filter and a χ 2 test. One key challenge is to distinguish cyber-attacks from large unknown disturbances arising from meal intake. This challenge is addressed by an online meal estimator, and a novel time-varying detection threshold. More precisely, we show that the ordinary least squares is the optimal unbiased estimator of the meal size under certain modelling assumptions. Moreover, we derive a novel time-varying threshold for the χ 2 detector to avoid false alarms during meal ingestion. The results are validated by means of numerical simulations.},

Such a constraint limits the increase in the control cost due to watermarking. To determine the optimal sequence regarding the addition or otherwise of watermarking signals, first, we formulate an infinite horizon stochastic optimal control problem with a termination state. Then applying the value iteration approach, we find an optional policy that minimizes the average detection delay (ADD) for fixed upper bounds on the false alarm rate (FAR) and ANW. The optimal policy turns out to be a two thresholds policy on the posterior probability of attack. We derive approximate expressions of ADD and FAR as functions of the two derived thresholds and a few other parameters. A simulation study on a single-input single-output system illustrates that the proposed method improves the control cost considerably at the expense of small increases in ADD. We also perform simulation studies to validate the derived theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Federated machine learning promises to overcome the input privacy challenge in machine learning. By iteratively updating a model on private clients and aggregating these local model updates into a global federated model, private data is incorporated in the federated model without needing to share and expose that data. Several open software projects for federated learning have appeared. Most of them focuses on supporting flexible experimentation with different model aggregation schemes and with different privacy-enhancing technologies. However, there is a lack of open frameworks that focuses on critical distributed computing aspects of the problem such as scalability and resilience. It is a big step to take for a data scientist to go from an experimental sandbox to testing their federated schemes at scale in real-world geographically distributed settings. To bridge this gap we have designed and developed a production-grade hierarchical federated learning framework, FEDn. The framework is specifically designed to make it easy to go from local development in pseudo-distributed mode to horizontally scalable distributed deployments. FEDn both aims to be production grade for industrial applications and a flexible research tool to explore real-world performance of novel federated algorithms and the framework has been used in number of industrial and academic R&D projects. In this paper we present the architecture and implementation of FEDn. We demonstrate the framework's scalability and efficiency in evaluations based on two case-studies representative for a cross-silo and a cross-device use-case respectively.},

Therefore, in this experience report, we investigate the quality of existing container scanning tools by considering two metrics that reflect coverage and accuracy. We analyze popular public container images hosted on DockerHub using different container scanning tools (i.e., Clair, Anchore, and Microscanner). Our findings show that existing container scanning tools do not detect application package vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we find that existing tools do not have high accuracy.},

In this article, we present a case study of the DII-HEP secure cloud infrastructure and propose an approach to securely scale-out a private cloud deployment to public clouds in order to support hybrid cloud scenarios. A challenge in such scenarios is that cloud vendors may offer varying and possibly incompatible ways to isolate and interconnect virtual machines located in different cloud networks. Our approach is tenant driven in the sense that the tenant provides its connectivity mechanism. We provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of a number of alternatives to solve this problem.

It has shown that with perfect knowledge of the system model and the capability to manipulate a certain number of measurements, the false data injection (FDI) attacks, as a class of data integrity attacks, can coordinate measurements corruption to keep stealth against the bad data detection schemes. However, a more realistic attack is essentially an attack with limited adversarial knowledge of the system model and limited attack resources due to various reasons. In this paper, we generalize the data attacks that they can be pure FDI attacks or combined with availability attacks (e.g., DoS attacks) and analyze the attacks with limited adversarial knowledge or limited attack resources. The attack impact is evaluated by the proposed metrics and the detection probability of attacks is calculated using the distribution property of data with or without attacks. The analysis is supported with results from a power system use case.

abstract = {This paper addresses the detection and isolation of replay attacks on sensor measurements. As opposed to previously proposed additive watermarking, we propose a multiplicative watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by being fed to a SISO watermark generator. Additionally, a set of equalizing filters is placed at the controller's side, which reconstructs the original output signals from the received watermarked data. We show that the proposed scheme has several advantages over existing approaches: it has no detrimental effects on the closed-loop performance in the absence of attacks; it can be designed in a modular fashion, independently of the design of the controller and anomaly detector; it facilitates the detection of replay attacks and the isolation of the time at which the replayed data was recorded. These properties are discussed in detail and the results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC). In networked control systems, leveraging the peculiarities of the cyber-physical domains and their interactions may lead to novel detection and defense mechanisms against malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a multiplicative sensor watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by a Single Input Single Output (SISO) filter. Hence, such scheme does not require communication between multiple sensors, but can still lead to detection and isolation of malicious cyber-attacks. In particular, we analyze the benefits of the proposed watermarking scheme for two attack scenarios: The physical sensor re-routing attack and the cyber measurement re-routing one. For each attack scenario, detectability and isolability properties are analyzed with and without the proposed watermarking scheme and we show how the watermarking scheme can be leveraged to detect cyber sensor routing attacks. In order to detect compromised sensors, we design an observer-based detector with a robust adaptive threshold. Additionally, we identify the sensors involved in the re-routing attacks by means of a tailored Recursive Least Squares parameter estimation algorithm. The results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE. We introduce a model of estimation in the presence of strategic, self-interested sensors. We employ a game-Theoretic setup to model the interaction between the sensors and the receiver. The cost function of the receiver is equal to the estimation error variance while the cost function of the sensor contains an extra term which is determined by its private information. We start by the single sensor case in which the receiver has access to a noisy but honest side information in addition to the message transmitted by a strategic sensor. We study both static and dynamic estimation problems. For both these problems, we characterize a family of equilibria in which the sensor and the receiver employ simple strategies. Interestingly, for the dynamic estimation problem, we find an equilibrium for which the strategic sensor uses a memory-less policy. We generalize the static estimation setup to multiple sensors with synchronous communication structure (i.e., all the sensors transmit their messages simultaneously). We prove the maybe surprising fact that, for the constructed equilibrium in affine strategies, the estimation quality degrades as the number of sensors increases. However, if the sensors are herding (i.e., copying each other policies), the quality of the receiver's estimation improves as the number of sensors increases. Finally, we consider the asynchronous communication structure (i.e., the sensors transmit their messages sequentially).},

Meanwhile, various risk assessment methods have been developed that integrate safety and security, and these could help to address the corresponding threats by implementing suitable risk treatment plans. However, an overarching overview of these methods, systematizing the characteristics of such methods, is missing. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review, and identify 7 integrated safety and security risk assessment methods. We analyze these methods based on 5 different criteria, and identify key characteristics and applications. A key outcome is the distinction between sequential and non-sequential integration of safety and security, related to the order in which safety and security risks are assessed. This study provides a basis for developing more effective integrated safety and security risk assessment methods in the future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. This paper introduces combined data integrity and availability attacks to expand the attack scenarios against power system state estimation. The goal of the adversary, who uses the combined attack, is to perturb the state estimates while remaining hidden from the observer. We propose security metrics that quantify vulnerability of power grids to combined data attacks under single and multi-path routing communication models. In order to evaluate the proposed security metrics, we formulate them as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The relation between the security metrics of combined data attacks and pure data integrity attacks is analyzed, based on which we show that, when data availability and data integrity attacks have the same cost, the two metrics coincide. When data availability attacks have a lower cost than data integrity attacks, we show that a combined data attack could be executed with less attack resources compared to pure data integrity attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that combined data attacks would bypass integrity-focused mitigation schemes. These conclusions are supported by the results obtained on a power system model with and without a communication model with single or multi-path routing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Energy management systems (EMS) are used to control energy usage in buildings and campuses, by employing technologies such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and building management systems (BMS), in order to provide reliable energy supply and maximise user comfort while minimising energy usage. Historically, EMS systems were installed when potential security threats were only physical. Nowadays, EMS systems are connected to the building network and as a result directly to the outside world. This extends the attack surface to potential sophisticated cyber-attacks, which adversely impact EMS operation, resulting in service interruption and downstream financial implications. Currently, the security systems that detect attacks operate independently to those which deploy resiliency policies and use very basic methods. We propose a novel EMS cyber-physical-security framework that executes a resilient policy whenever an attack is detected using security analytics. In this framework, both the resilient policy and the security analytics are driven by EMS data, where the physical correlations between the data-points are identified to detect outliers and then the control loop is closed using an estimated value in place of the outlier. The framework has been tested using a reduced order model of a real EMS site.},

In the cybersecurity community it is common to think of security as a design feature for systems and infrastructures that may be difficult to balance with other requirements. What is less studied is how security requirements come about, for which reasons, and what their influence is on the actions the system facilitates. Security is for example often used as an argument for or against granting access rights that are of importance to stakeholders, such as in the discussion on counterterrorism and privacy. This paper argues that the ongoing politicization of security issues calls for a paradigm to study cybersecurity as a Politikum: a matter of political concern, embedded in existing and future infrastructures. We summarize literature which inspired this paper and explain the role of security arguments for infrastructure governance. Then we outline the new paradigm and its core concepts and contribution, including the notion of framing. Finally, we present discourse analysis and infrastructure ethnography as research methods and discuss cases in which discourses (may) shape infrastructures, in particular smart cities.},

We follow up with surveying information technology and control-centric security tools that can be used to improve the resilience of industrial control systems. Feedback control loops are core components in the Smart Grid, as they enable the maximal utilization of the physical infrastructure and its resources. As the number of control loops in the Smart Grid increases, the cyber security challenges faced by ICSs become increasingly important within the Smart Grid's context. To highlight such novel challenges, we give an overview of the envisioned control loops in future Smart Grids, and discuss the potential impact of cyber threats targeting critical Smart Grid functionalities. As a case study, false-data injection attacks on power transmission networks are considered. The level of resilience to such attacks is assessed through a control-centric risk assessment methodology, which is also used for allocating the deployment of more modern and secure equipment.

In particular, the threat scenarios tackled in the paper consider adversaries that aim at deteriorating the system's performance by maximizing the corresponding quadratic cost function, while remaining stealthy with respect to anomaly detectors. As opposed to other work in the literature, the effect of the adversary's actions on the anomaly detector's output is not constrained to be zero at all times. Moreover, scenarios where the adversary has uncertain model knowledge are also addressed. The set of strategic attack policies is formulated as a non-convex constrained optimization problem, leading to a sensitivity metric denoted as the output-to-output ℓ2-gain. Using the framework of dissipative systems, the output-to-output gain is computed through an equivalent convex optimization problem. Additionally, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the output-to-output gain to be unbounded, with and without model uncertainties, which are tightly related to the invariant zeros of the system.},

Each microgrid is abstracted as a power inverter that can be controlled to regulate its voltage magnitude and phase-angle independently. Moreover, each power inverter is modeled as a single integrator, whose input is given by a voltage droop-control policy that is computed based on voltage magnitude and reactive power injection measurements. Under mild assumptions, we then establish important properties of the nominal linearized closed-loop system, such as stability, positivity, and diagonal dominance. These properties play an important role when characterizing the potential impact of different attack scenarios. In particular, we discuss two attack scenarios where the adversary corrupts measurement data and reference signals received by the voltage droop controllers.

abstract = {In this paper the problem of revealing stealthy data-injection attacks on control systems is addressed. In particular we consider the scenario where the attacker performs zero-dynamics attacks on the system. First, we characterize and analyze the stealthiness properties of these attacks for linear time-invariant systems. Then we tackle the problem of detecting such attacks by modifying the system's structure. Our results provide necessary and sufficient conditions that the modifications should satisfy in order to detect the zero-dynamics attacks. The results and proposed detection methods are illustrated through numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, the existence of unknown input observers for networks of interconnected second-order linear time invariant systems is studied. Two classes of distributed control systems of large practical relevance are considered. It is proved that for these systems, one can construct a bank of unknown input observers, and use them to detect and isolate faults in the network. The result presents a distributed implementation. In particular, by exploiting the system structure, this work provides further insight into the design of UIO for networked systems. Moreover, the importance of certain network measurements is shown. Infeasibility results with respect to available measurements and faults are also provided, as well as methods to remove faulty agents from the network. Applications to power networks and robotic formations are presented. It is shown how the developed methodology apply to a power network described by the swing equation with a faulty bus. For a multi-robot system, it is illustrated how a faulty robot can be detected and removed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the cyber security of state estimators in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems operating in power grids. Safe and reliable operation of these critical infrastructure systems is a major concern in our society. In current state estimation algorithms there are bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect random outliers in the measurement data. Such schemes are based on high measurement redundancy. Although such methods may detect a set of very basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of a more intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where deception attacks are performed, sending false information to the control center. Similar attacks have been studied before for linear state estimators, assuming the attacker has perfect model knowledge. Here we instead assume the attacker only possesses a perturbed model. Such a model may correspond to a partial model of the true system, or even an out-dated model. We characterize the attacker by a set of objectives, and propose policies to synthesize stealthy deceptions attacks, both in the case of linear and nonlinear estimators. We show that the more accurate model the attacker has access to, the larger deception attack he can perform undetected. Specifically, we quantify trade-offs between model accuracy and possible attack impact for different BDD schemes. The developed tools can be used to further strengthen and protect the critical state-estimation component in SCADA systems. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},
