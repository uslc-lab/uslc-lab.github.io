[//]: # (* **Deadline March 28, 2025:** [1 PhD position in Automatic Control focusing on secure control under uncertainty](https://uu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:795517/))


[//]: # (Our vision is to develop methodologies for designing intelligent autonomous decision-making systems that are secure and resilient against malicious adversaries.)


**Note:** Sometimes we do not have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. In those periods, we can only welcome you if you have a fellowship or grant. 

**Interested in applying to grant?** Take a look at the [VR International Postdoc grant](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/calls/2021-11-17-international-post-doc-grant-within-natural-and-engineering-sciences-spring-call.html) or the [Marie Curie Postdoc fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships). **Get in touch if you would like to apply through our group!**


## Local thesis projects:
We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on basic and applied research at the intersection of cybersecurity, control theory, and machine learning. 

You will take an acive role in determining the important and interesting research questions to tackle, creating novel scientific methodologies and tailoring them for specific practical applications, developing new adversary models and defense mechanisms, and evaluating the proposed methods on experimental setups.

### Master and Bachelor projects for Uppsala University students
If you are a Master or Bachelor student at Uppsala University looking for a degree project, contact me (or any group member) per email or drop by my office.

At the moment, we have several proposals for MSc thesis projects at our group, candidates are interviewed continuously **until early December 2023**. See [the list and details](https://tinyurl.com/MSc2024-SysCon) for how to apply!

### Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Uppsala University, see [the University's website](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/).
